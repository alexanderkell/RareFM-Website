These suggestions will include titles, character names, genres, and even plot twists and endings.The stories will usually be humorous, always different and entertaining. They will hopefully cover a range of genres, from fairy tales to thrillers, from documentaries to autobiographies. Ben and Julia, as well as providing the voices and narration (with various accents) they will also provide vocal sound effects, and would like to use any available sound effects that Rare may be able to provide.Improv Story Time will bring something new and exciting to Rare FM.
